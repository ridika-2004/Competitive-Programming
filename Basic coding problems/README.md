# Basic Coding Problems

Welcome to the **Basic Coding Problems** repository! 

In this repository, you'll find a collection of basic coding problems primarily solved in **C++**, but you'll also find some solutions in **C**, **Java**, and maybe a few others!

### Problems include:
- Common problems of programming!
- Implementing in-built libraries,trees,algorithms!
- Classic data structure problems (e.g., Valid Parentheses, Linked Lists, etc.)!
- And much more!

### What's New?
I've tried to add pdfs as solution approach!!
