# Codeforces-solutions

Hello, I'm Ridika, a novice coder. Here's my Codeforces handle: https://codeforces.com/profile/nazninridika2004

I've tried to add the solutions I've done so far. You can search for the problem by its ID, like 4A, 122B, etc.

Or if you can't find it, see the id in the url and copy it to search here. Also if you can't find a problem with that format, it means I haven't solved it yet :)
